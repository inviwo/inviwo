 * \brief Responsible for the main AnimationController and saving it in the workspace.

 * stored in the workspace. The main Animation can only be changed through WorkspaceAnimations.
 *
 * The controller is cleared, saved, and loaded when the workspace is cleared, saved, or loaded.
 *
 * The MainAnimation also manages the ModuleCallback actions used to
 * create property tracks from the context menu of properties.
 *
 * This object is not intended to be used from within the Network, e.g. in a Processor, but rather
 * from the outside. See the for AnimationQt module for examples.
