/** \docpage{org.inviwo.HeightFieldMapper, Height Field Mapper}
 * Maps a heightfield onto a geometry and renders it to an image.
 * The Height Field Mapper converts an arbitrary 2D input image to a grayscale float
 * image to be used in the Height Field Renderer processor. Additionally, data values
 * are mapped to either an user-defined range or are scaled to fit in a given maximum
 * height based on the sea level.
 * ![](org.inviwo.HeightFieldMapper.png?classIdentifier=org.inviwo.HeightFieldMapper)
 *
 *
 * ### Inports
 *   * __ImageInport__ The heightfield input. If the image has multiple channels only
 *                     the red channel is used.
 *
 * ### Outports
 *   * __ImageOutport__ The scaled height field (single channel).
 *
 * ### Properties
 *   * __Scaling Mode__    The heightfield is scaled to either a fixed range (0 to 1), to a
 *                         user-specified range (__Height Range__), or based on the sea level
 *                         (__Sea Level__ and __Maximum Height__).
 *   * __Height Range__    Min/max range for data range scaling.
 *   * __Maximum Height__  Max height used in sea level scaling.
 *   * __Sea Level__       Sea level around which the heightfield is scaled.
