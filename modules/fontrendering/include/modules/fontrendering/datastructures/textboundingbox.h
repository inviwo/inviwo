/**
 * \struct TextBoundingBox
 *
 * \brief struct for holding bounding box information for a specific text
 *
 * The textual bounding box for a string has its origin (0,0) at the bottom-left corner and is
 * given by its extent. The bounding box enclosing all glyphs has its own origin relative to (0,0).
 * The first line starts at (0,0) + textExtent.y - ascender (i.e. getBaseLineOffset()).
 *
 * The glyph bounding box might be larger than the textual bounding box. It is guaranteed to
 * enclose all glyphs including overhang, e.g. caused by italic glyphs or glyphs exceeding
 * ascend and descend.
