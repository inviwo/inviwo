 * ![](org.inviwo.PropertyAnalyzer.png?classIdentifier=org.inviwo.PropertyAnalyzer)
 *
 * Test whether changing properties of the processors generating the
 * input image have the desired effect.
 * Specifically, a test is a set of value assignments to properties
 * such that there is at most one assignment per property.
 * For each test we set each property to its respective value (regarding the
 * assignments) and count the pixels with a given color. We call this number of
 * pixels the score of a test.
 * Two tests are comparable, if and only if the relations implied by the scores
 * are non-contradictory (there are for instance no two properties, such that
 * one implies that the score of test1 should be less than the score of test2 and the
 * other that is should be greater).
 * For all pairs of comparable tests we then verify that the relation of the
 * scores matches the relation implied by the properties. All failed pairs are
 * then exported in an HTML report.
 * The report is also converted into an image that is available at the outport.
 * This enables to verify the behaviour of properties by regression testing.
 * If desired, the testing is followed by a distillation process, where a smallest set of
 * tested properties is found such that some pair of tests still fails.
 *
 * ### Inports
 *   * __inport__ The image that is used to determine the effects of changing
 *   properties, i.e. the number of matching pixels is counted in this image.
 *   Note that only properties from predecessors of this PropertyAnalyzer processor are
 *   available for testing.
 *
 * ### Outports
 *   * __outport__ The report of errors, or a completely white image if there
 *   were no errors.
 *
 * ### Properties
 *   * __Report Directory__ The directory where the report and all generated
 *   images are saved.
 *   * __Use Depth__ Determines, whether the number of background pixels (i.e.
 *   those with depth value 1) or pixels with a specific color should be
 *   counted.
 *   * __Color__ The color of the pixels that should be counted. Is only visible
 *   (and relevant) when __Use Depth__ is unchecked.
 *   * __Count number of pixels__ Counts the number of matching pixels and
 *   prints it to the console.
 *   * __Update Test Results__ Kicks of the testing process.
 *   * __Distill Failed Tests__ Repeats the tests in order to find a smallest
 *   set of properties that lead to errors._
 *   * __Maximum number of tests__ Maximum number of tests that should be
 *   executed
 *   * __Description__ A textual description of the effects of properties.
 *
 *   For each processor that is a predecessor of this one, there is a
 *   *CompositeBoolProperty* containing the settings for all its properties.
 *   The settings for a property consist of *CompositeBoolProperty* and as many
 *   drop-down lists as the property has components. The checkbox of the
 *   *CompositeBoolProperty* dictates
 *   whether the property shall be tested, and the drop-down menus determine the
 *   expected change of the score when the components value is increased.
 *
 *   In the following example, we use a *RandomVolumeGenerator* to create a
 *   volume from a seed and then generate an image by a network containing,
 *   among others, a *Cube Proxy Geometry*. 
 *   When the *PropertyAnalyzer*-processor just has been created, it outputs a completely white
 *   image, since no errors have been found.
 *   Note that the *PropertyAnalyzer*-processor contains *CompositeProperty*s for
 *   each preceding processor in the network.
 *   Since we pass the output image of the network to the *PropertyAnalyzer*-processor
 *   before a background is applied, we need use the __Use Depth__ option to count
 *   the number of background pixels.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_1.png width=85%
 *   We want to test our network with varying seeds for the
 *   *RandomVolumeGenerator* , so the respective box in the *CompositeProperty*
 *   of the *RandomVolumeGenerator* is checked. Since different seeds allow no
 *   meaningful comparison of the number of visible background pixels, we set
 *   its comparator to *NOT_COMPARABLE*.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_2.png width=85%
 *   We also want to verify the *Cube Proxy Geometry* -processor. For the sake of
 *   simplicity we only consider clipping in the X- and Y-dimensions.
 *   The clipping options for each dimension are *MinMaxProperty* s, so we need
 *   two comparators each, one for the lower and one for the upper setting.
 *   When we move the lower setting up, the score (i.e. the number of background pixels)
 *   should increase or remain equal, so this comparator is set to *GREATER_EQUAL*.
 *   For the upper setting, the opposite is true.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_3.png width=85%
 *   To demonstrate this processor, we set false comparators for the clipping in
 *   the Y-dimension.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_4.png width=85%
 *   On hitting "Update Test Results", a bunch of tests is generated and
 *   executed.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_5.png width=85%
 *   When all tests are finished, some errors are found and the first few are
 *   printed on the console.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_6.png width=85%
 *   All errors are documented in an HTML-report. For each error, the values
 *   of each tested property, as well as the scores of both tests,
 *   their expected relation and the generated images are shown.
 *   @image html prop_analyzer_7.png width=85%
 *   When errors have been found, we have the option to distill the failed
 *   tests, i.e. to find a subset of properties that - if tested - produces some
 *   errors. This leads to the tests being run again, except that some
 *   properties are not changed.
 *   Afterwards a new report is generated, which now only contains the tests
 *   that have failed with the distilled set of properties.
