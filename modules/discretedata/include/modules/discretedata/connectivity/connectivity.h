/** \class Connectivity
 *   \brief Basis interface of all connectivity types.
 *
 *   The connectivity between coordinates creates a mesh,
 *   a graph, a cell complex, or some other structure.
 *   It joins coordinates to a larger entity
 *   and puts them in a neighborhood relation.
 *
 *   A connectivity can define several neighborhood relations.
 *   For example, a uniform grid would have 0D vertices,
 *   1D grid edges, 2D grid faces, and 3D grid cells/voxels.
 *   The connectivity defines these neighborhood relations
 *   and allows iterating over them.
 *
 *   This refers to the 'topological space'
 *   in <em>Vector-Bundle Classes Form Powerful Tool for Scientific Visualization</em>,
 *   Butler and Bryson, 1992.
 *
 *  Connectivity and Coordinates jointly define the manifold
 *   in the above paper.
