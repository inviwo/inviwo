/**
 * \class SequenceProcessor
 * \brief A processor containing a network of processors, i.e. it will act as a sub network within a
 * processor network. A SequenceProcessor can be used to reduce cluttering in the network. Also
 * makes it easy to reuse groups of processors inside of a network, and across network since they
 * can be saved in the processor list. A SequenceProcessor is usually created by selecting a group
 * of processors that are closely related in the network editor and then clicking "create
 * composite" in the context menu.  Use InviwoModule::registerSequenceProcessor to register a saved
 * composite in your module.
 *
 * The network inside of the SequenceProcessors is called the sub network and the network of the
 * SequenceProcessor the super network. The SequenceProcessor will only evaluate its sub network
 * when its process function is called, and otherwise keep it locked.
 *
 * <b>How it works</b>
 * The SequenceProcessor will observe its sub network and when a processor gets added to the sub
 * network the SequenceProcessor will check if it's a CompositeSource or a CompositeSink. In the
 * case it's a CompositeSource, which acts as data inputs in the sub network, in will get the
 * special "super" inport and add it to it self. If it's a CompositeSink, which acts as data
 * outputs, it will get the "super" outport and add it to it self.
 *
 * When the CompositeSource gets evaluated in the sub network it will take the data from its super
 * inport and put in its outport, moving the data from the super network to the sub network. At the
 * end of the sub network evaluation the SinkProcessors will be evaluated and take the data on its
 * inport and put on its super outport, moving the data from the sub network into the super network.
 *
 * Properties in the sub network that are marked with application usage mode, or added by calling
 * addSuperProperty, will be cloned and added to the composite processor with mutual onChange
 * callbacks to keep them in sync, exposing the sub property's state to the super network.
 *
 * Events are propagated through the sub network using the super inport and outports in the Source
 * and Sink Processors.
 *
 * <b>Design considerations</b>
 * Many designs for composite processors were considered, including implementing it as a pure GUI
 * feature having all the processors in the same network. The current design of completely
 * encapsulating the sub network was chosen since it minimizes the amount of logic in the GUI. Hence
 * keeping the simple mapping from processor network to GUI. It also completely hides the sub
 * network from the super network making it possible to compose sub network in several layers out of
 * the box.
