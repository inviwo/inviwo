 * \class MemoryFileHandle
 * \brief RAII class for providing a FILE stream handle to a buffer in memory.
 *      This class will open a file handle to /dev/null and use a dedicated buffer for
 *      buffering. As long as less bytes than getBufferSize() bytes are written/read, its
 *      status is well defined. However, after writing more than buffer size bytes, the
 *      buffer contents will be flushed, i.e. are no longer accessible.
 *
 *      To detect potential overflows, the entire buffer is initialized with the value 0xaf.
 *      If the number of bytes in the buffer is less than the buffer size, the next 8 bytes
 *      are checked whether they contain 0xaf. If not, then there was a potential buffer
 *      overflow.
