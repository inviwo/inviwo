/**
 * A DataVisualizer can be used to easily add a visualization of a data type.
 * A DataVisualizer has two tasks. The first is to create a "Source Processor" which can be used to
 * load data of the supported type. The second is to create a "Visualizer Network", which gets data
 * (from an Outport) or loads data (from a "Source Processor") and generates some useful
 * visualization. Both parts a optional, and can be used independently or together, like:
 *     1) Adding a source processor that can load the requested file
 *     2) Adding a set of processors that will take input from a existing port to create
 *        a visualization
 *     3) Both 1 and 2
 *
 * An Inviwo module can add new DataVisualizer by deriving from DataVisualizer,
 * implementing all the virtual functions, and then add register it using
 * DataVisualizerManager::registerDataVisualizer.
 * @see DataVisualizerManager
