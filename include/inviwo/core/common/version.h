 * \class Version
 * \brief Parses a version string "Major.Minor.Patch.Build" and allow versions to be compared.
 * Try to follow semantic versioning: http://semver.org/
 * A nuanced picture, i.e. reasons why you do not necessarily need to follow semantic versioning:
 * "Why Semantic Versioning Isn't": https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e
 *
 * 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
 * 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
 * 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
 * 4. BUILD version can be used as metadata.
 *
 * Major and minor versions are used during equal comparison since
 * API changes should not exist in patch and build version changes
 * (unless major version is zero).
 *
 * @note Module versions are tied to the Inviwo core version, which means
 *       that there is no need to update module version if it is built for
 *       a new Inviwo core version.
